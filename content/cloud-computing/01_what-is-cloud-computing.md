  <img src="/img/courses/cloud/cloud.png" style="width:855px; height: 400px; align-content: center; margin: 25px;"/>


- Cloud Computing is a revolutionary paradigm, encompassing the seamless storage and retrieval of data and computing services via the internet. Distinct from traditional methods, it refrains from storing data on personal computers, offering instead the dynamic provision of computer services, including servers, data storage, networking, and databases, on-demand. At its core, cloud computing aims to democratize access to expansive data centers, serving the needs of myriad users. Moreover, it facilitates remote data access, empowering users to connect with information housed on distant servers.

### Prequel: Server-Based Computing

In the realm of information technology, server-based computing represents a paradigm where applications are hosted and executed on a centralized server. The fundamental premise of server-based computing lies in the server itself, which serves as the bedrock for the entire network or system.

### Definition of Server-Based Computing:

Server-based computing, as the term implies, revolves around the notion of applications running and operating primarily on a server. In this architecture, the server takes on the role of a dedicated computing powerhouse, responsible for managing and dispensing network resources. The pivotal element is the centralized server, which acts as the nerve center of the entire system.

### Understanding a Server:
A server, in the context of server-based computing, refers to a specialized computer explicitly designated to oversee and regulate network resources. In simpler terms, a server is an instantiation of a computer program designed to receive and process requests from other programs within the networkâ€”these other programs being commonly referred to as clients. The server's purpose is to accept these requests and provide timely responses, facilitating seamless communication within the network.

### Server-Based Computing Dynamics:
The concept of server-based computing has been in existence for several years, rooted in the objective of consolidating data and various resources on a centralized server. Clients, which may include desktop computers and laptops, interact with the server by soliciting access to its resources. The server, acting as a central repository, becomes the focal point for resource sharing, streamlining data management, and application execution.

## Why the Name Cloud? 
  <img src="/img/courses/cloud/server.png" style="width:855px; height: 400px; align-content: center; margin: 25px;"/>


- The term "Cloud" originated from a network design crafted by engineers to illustrate the positioning and interconnections among diverse network devices. The configuration of this network design resembled the fluid and interconnected nature of a cloud.


## Why Cloud Computing?


- As the number of computer and mobile users continues to rise, the imperative of data storage has become paramount across all sectors. Businesses, both large and small, heavily depend on their data and allocate significant financial resources to its maintenance. Establishing a robust IT infrastructure and a centralized storage hub is crucial. However, not every business can bear the high costs associated with in-house IT infrastructure and backup support services. Enter Cloud Computing a more cost-effective solution. Its efficacy in data storage, computation, and reduced maintenance costs has not only appealed to smaller enterprises but has also successfully attracted larger businesses.

- Cloud computing alleviates the hardware and software demands on the user's end. The user needs only to operate the cloud computing system's interface software, which can be as simple as a web browser, and the cloud network handles the rest. Many of us have encountered cloud computing in various instances, with popular cloud services such as Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo serving as prime examples.

- When we access email services, our data is stored on a cloud server rather than on our personal computers. The technology and infrastructure powering the cloud remain invisible to users. Whether cloud services are based on HTTP, XML, Ruby, PHP, or other specific technologies is of lesser importance as long as they are user-friendly and functional. Individual users can seamlessly connect to the cloud system from their own devices, be it desktops, laptops, or mobile devices.

- Cloud computing proves to be a game-changer for small businesses with limited resources, granting them access to technologies that were once beyond their reach. Moreover, it enables small businesses to convert their maintenance costs into profit. How does this work?

- In an in-house IT server, meticulous attention is required to ensure smooth operations, and any technical glitches demand your complete responsibility, necessitating significant attention, time, and financial investment for repairs. In contrast, cloud computing shifts this responsibility to the service provider, who takes charge of complications and technical faults, freeing businesses from the burden of intensive maintenance.

## Types of cloud.

- ### Private Cloud:
In this model, computing resources are exclusively deployed for a specific organization, primarily catering to intra-business interactions. The organization has complete governance, ownership, and operational control over these computing resources.

- ### Community Cloud:
This approach involves providing computing resources for a community and various organizations within it. It facilitates collaborative usage by multiple entities sharing common interests or objectives.

- ### Public Cloud:
Primarily employed for B2C (Business to Consumer) interactions, the public cloud entails computing resources owned, governed, and operated by a government entity, academic institution, or business organization. It serves as a platform for widespread consumer engagement.

- ### Hybrid Cloud:
Designed for versatile use in both B2B (Business to Business) and B2C scenarios, the hybrid cloud integrates computing resources from different clouds. This deployment method earns its designation as a hybrid cloud due to the amalgamation of diverse clouds to cater to various interaction types.

## Cloud Computing Services?
<strong>The three major Cloud Computing Offerings are.</strong>

- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

*Different business use some or all of these components according to their requirement.*

### Software as a Service (SaaS):
Software as a Service, commonly known as SaaS, represents a software distribution model where applications are hosted by a vendor or service provider and accessible to customers over the internet. The rising prominence of SaaS is attributed to the supporting technologies of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) or Web Services. This delivery model allows users worldwide to access the service through the internet.

  <img src="/img/courses/cloud/Saas.png" style="width:855px; height: 400px; align-content: center; margin: 25px;"/>

Historically, the conventional approach to acquiring software involved an upfront purchase followed by installation on individual computers. In contrast, Software as a Service (SaaS) users opt for a subscription model, typically on a monthly basis, accessed via the internet.

Individuals or entities requiring access to specific software can subscribe as users, whether it be for a single user, a small team, or the entirety of a corporation's thousands of employees. SaaS seamlessly integrates with all internet-enabled devices.

SaaS proves versatile for a multitude of essential tasks such as accounting, sales, invoicing, and planning, offering a comprehensive solution accessible to users across various industries.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS).

Platform as a Service (PaaS):

Platform as a Service, commonly known as PaaS, offers a dynamic platform and environment for developers to create applications and services. This cloud-hosted service is accessible to users over the internet.

To simplify, consider the analogy of painting a picture, where your school teacher provides you with various paint colors, an assortment of paint brushes, and paper. Your task is to create a beautiful picture using these provided tools.

- Key Features of PaaS Services:

PaaS services undergo continuous updates, integrating new features. This benefits software developers, web developers, and businesses alike. PaaS furnishes a supportive platform for application development, encompassing software support, management services, storage, networking, deployment, testing, collaboration, hosting, and maintenance of applications.

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)


IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
IaaS (Infrastructure As A Service) is one of the fundamental service model of cloud computing alongside PaaS( Platform as a Service). It provides access to computing resources in a virtualized environment the cloud on internet. It provides computing infrastructure like virtual server space, network connections, bandwidth, load balancers and IP addresses. The pool of hardware resource is extracted from multiple servers and networks usually distributed across numerous data centers. This provides redundancy and reliability to IaaS.
