## How to deploy cloud ?

Cloud computing provides a reliable and cost- effective setting for deploying web applications. However, choosing and configuring an appropriate cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), e.g., the appropriate database and computing instances and acceptable service rates, is a daunting task. The task is also challenging when trying to optimize the IaaS for conflicting objectives such as performance and cost. Furthermore, due to lack of understanding of the pricing model and the cloud IaaS, a cloud consumer may pay more than necessary or may not fully utilize the purchased resources.
