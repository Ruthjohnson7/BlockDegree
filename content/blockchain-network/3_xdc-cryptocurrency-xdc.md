- XDC (XinFin Digital Contract) is the native cryptocurrency of the XinFin Network (formerly known as XDC Network). XinFin Network is a blockchain platform designed for enterprise use cases, and XDC is the digital asset used within the network. It serves various functions:

##  XDC as the Native Cryptocurrency


<img src="/img/courses/xdc/xdctoken.png" style="width:855px; height: 400px; align-content: center; margin: 25px;"/>

XDC is indeed the native cryptocurrency of the XinFin Network, and this means it is the primary digital asset that underpins the entire blockchain ecosystem. Just like other blockchain networks have their own native cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin for the Bitcoin network, Ether for the Ethereum network), XDC serves as the fundamental digital currency within the XinFin Network.

The XDC token is used as a payment and settlements layer by financial institutions and decentralized applications (dApps) built on the XinFin hybrid blockchain. Also, the XDC token provides a gateway to financial services that help small and medium businesses integrate the XDC protocol.

Several applications and services use the XDC token. These include the peer-to-peer trading platform, TradeFinex, the digital asset management service, MyContract, plus a range of educational establishments, financial services, banks, and technology companies. Also, the XDC token is used for land registry record management, online invoicing, and much more! According to CoinGecko, at the time of writing, the XDC token is trading at around $0.14, with a market cap of $1.8 billion. The XDC token has replaced the ERC-20 compatible XDCe taken, which has now been phased out. Here's an explanation with an example:


- ### Explanation:


Native Cryptocurrency: A native cryptocurrency is the digital token that is native to and operates within a specific blockchain network. It is used for various purposes within that network.


- ### Example:


Imagine you're a business that wants to use the XinFin Network for international trade and supply chain financing. In this scenario, XDC, as the native cryptocurrency, plays a pivotal role:

##  XDC Wallets and Transactions
- An XDC wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to store, send, and receive XDC tokens. These wallets are similar to traditional wallets, but they are digital and can be accessed from anywhere.


- **XDC wallets work by utilizing public-key cryptography.** When a user creates an [XDC wallet](https://xinfin.network/#webWallet), they are given a public key and a private key. The public key is used to receive XDC tokens, while the private key is used to send XDC tokens. These keys are stored in the XDC blockchain network, which is a decentralized and distributed ledger.


- When a user wants to send XDC tokens to another user, they create a transaction and sign it with their private key. The transaction is then broadcasted to the XDC blockchain network, where it is verified by a network of nodes. Once the transaction is verified, the XDC tokens are transferred from the sender's wallet to the receiver's wallet.


- The XDC network is EVM compatible> The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a decentralized virtual machine that was originally built on top of the Ethereum blockchain but has since been adopted by other chains and technology to leverage its functionality. The EVM is a critical component of the XDC ecosystem because it allows developers to write and deploy smart contracts on the XDC blockchain with traditionally Ethereum tool sets.


- Smart contracts are code that run on the blockchain, they are what make up Dapps, Tokens, and automated agreements on the network. They can be used to automate the execution of contracts, agreements, and other types of applications. Smart contracts are executed by the EVM, which runs on top of the XDC blockchain.


- The XDC network is fully compatible with the EVM, which means that developers can write and deploy smart contracts on the XDC network using the same tools and programming languages that they use on the Ethereum network. This is made possible by XDC's use of the Ethereum client, which provides full EVM compatibility.


- XDC's compatibility with the EVM makes it easier for developers to create and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on the XDC network. These dApps can be used to create new financial solutions, such as decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and payment systems as well as create fully autonomous start ups who leverage the blockchain infrastructure to run and scale globally..

## Using XDC in Enterprise Applications


- XDC (XinFin Digital Contract) can be used effectively in a wide range of enterprise applications due to its features and capabilities. Here are some ways in which XDC can be employed in enterprise settings:


1. **Supply Chain Management:**
XDC can facilitate transparency and efficiency in supply chain processes. Smart contracts can be used to automate and verify the movement of goods and payments as they progress through the supply chain. Payments can be made in XDC upon the successful completion of certain milestones, reducing the need for intermediaries and ensuring that transactions are secure and tamper-proof.


2. **Trade Finance:**
Enterprises can use XDC to streamline trade finance operations. By utilizing smart contracts, they can automate the process of issuing letters of credit, escrow services, and trade settlement. This reduces the time and cost associated with traditional trade finance methods.


3. **Cross-Border Payments:**
XDC's fast transaction processing times make it a suitable choice for cross-border payments. Enterprises can use XDC to transfer funds internationally with reduced fees and shorter settlement times compared to traditional banking systems.


4. **Tokenization of Assets:**
XDC can be used to tokenize real-world assets such as real estate, stocks, or commodities. These digital tokens can represent ownership or value in these assets and can be traded or used as collateral in financial transactions.


5. **Supply Chain Financing:**
XDC can be used to provide financing options for suppliers in a supply chain. Smart contracts can be programmed to release funds to suppliers as soon as goods are shipped or received, reducing the need for lengthy credit assessment processes.


6. **Compliance and Auditing:**
The transparency and immutability of blockchain technology make XDC suitable for maintaining compliance records and conducting audits. Enterprises can use blockchain to securely store and share compliance data.


- ## Real-Life Application:-

- **TradeFinex** - A Trade Finance Platform: XinFin's [TradeFinex platform ](https://www.tradefinex.org/)is designed for trade finance solutions. It enables various parties involved in international trade, such as buyers, suppliers, and financiers, to connect and collaborate on a blockchain network powered by XinFin's XDC cryptocurrency.


- **Use Case:** Companies involved in global trade, especially in the agriculture and commodity sectors, were using TradeFinex to streamline and automate trade finance processes. TradeFinex helped reduce the time and costs associated with trade finance, improving transparency and efficiency. For example, it facilitated the creation of smart contracts that automatically released funds as goods were shipped and received, reducing the need for manual paperwork and delays in financing.
