**1. Immutable:**


Immutability means that once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be modified or deleted. Each node in the network maintains a copy of the digital ledger. Transactions are added to the network only after validation by the majority of nodes, ensuring the records are irreversible and unchangeable.


**2. Distributed:**


Blockchain's distributed nature offers complete transparency.
Every participant on the network has a copy of the ledger.
Changes propagate quickly across the network, as all nodes validate and maintain the ledger.


**3. Decentralized:**


Blockchain operates without a central authority.
A large number of nodes work together to verify and validate transactions.
Decentralization enhances organization, fault-tolerance, and security.
It reduces the risk of failure and minimizes the potential for attacks.


**4. Secure:**


All blockchain records are individually encrypted, adding an extra layer of security.
Every piece of data has a unique cryptographic identity.
Blocks are cryptographically linked, making it virtually impossible to modify data without changing all hash IDs.


**5. Consensus:**


Consensus is a decision-making algorithm used by nodes to reach quick and unbiased agreements.
It ensures smooth network operation and is crucial for making decisions in a decentralized environment.Different consensus algorithms exist, each with its pros and cons.


**6. Unanimous:**


Network participants must agree on the validity of records before they are added.
Majority voting is required for a block to be added. Records are updated simultaneously and propagate quickly.


**7. Faster Settlement:**


Blockchain enables faster settlement compared to traditional banking systems, which can take days to process transactions.
This speed and efficiency make it a valuable feature for various applications.
## Additional Features of Blockchain:


**Smart Contracts:**


Blockchain facilitates the creation and execution of smart contracts, self-executing agreements based on predefined conditions.
Smart contracts have applications in various industries, automating processes and reducing the need for intermediaries.


**Transparency:**


Blockchain's public ledger provides transparency as all transactions are visible to anyone.
This transparency reduces the risk of fraud and corruption.


**Wide-ranging Applications:**


Blockchain has diverse applications, extending beyond cryptocurrencies.
Some prominent uses include supply chain management, identity verification, and voting systems.
Its potential to revolutionize industries like healthcare, real estate, and finance is being explored, promising more secure, efficient, and effective business and governmental procedures.
