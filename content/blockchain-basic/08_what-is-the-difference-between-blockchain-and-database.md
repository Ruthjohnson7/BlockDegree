In a traditional database system, data is housed within a single authorised server or a cluster of authorised servers (as seen in shared environments like MongoDB). Users must place their trust in the organisation managing these servers, hoping that data won't be tampered with and that server security remains uncompromised.


On the other hand, blockchain technology revolutionises data storage. Here, all data is stored openly on a decentralised, peer-to-peer network and subject to public verification. The magic behind this verification is cryptography, including encryption and hashing. The transparent, public nature of the blockchain makes it an exceptionally formidable fortress against hacking attempts.


Privacy is another realm where blockchain shines. In traditional databases, user data, including sensitive access tokens and login credentials, resides on centralised servers, potentially raising privacy concerns. Blockchain takes a unique approach: nodes within the blockchain network often operate incognito, with user identities veiled behind public cryptographic keys. To confirm the authorization of transactions or blocks, one must validate the digital signature against the node's public key.


Moreover, the blockchain introduces a whole new dimension of verification and consensus. In traditional databases, these elements are often neglected. However, in the world of blockchain, they are fundamental. A proof of work (PoW) or proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism is essential to maintain a single, universally accepted state of the blockchain across the peer-to-peer network. This mechanism ensures the trustworthiness and accuracy of all transactions and blocks, enhancing the security and reliability of the blockchain.
