# Public Blockchain

- It is a permissionless distributed ledger on which anybody can join and conduct transactions.
- It is a non-restrictive form of the ledger in which each peer has a copy. This also means that anyone with an internet connection can access the public Blockchain.


- This user has access to historical and contemporary records and the ability to perform mining operations.


- These complex computations must be performed to verify transactions and add them to the ledger.


- On the blockchain network, no valid record or transaction may be altered. Because the source code is usually open, anybody can check the transactions, uncover problems, and suggest fixes.
## Advantages of Public Blockchain -


* Trustable: Public Blockchain nodes do not need to know or trust each other because the proof-of-work procedure ensures no fraudulent transactions.


* Secure: A public network can have as many participants or nodes as it wants, making it a secure network. The higher the network's size, the more records are distributed, and the more difficult it is for hackers to hack the entire network.


* Open and Transparent: The data on a public blockchain is transparent to all member nodes. Every authorized node has a copy of the blockchain records or digital ledger.


## Disadvantages of Public Blockchain -


* **Lower TPS:** The number of transactions per second in a public blockchain is extremely low. This is because it is a large network with many nodes which take time to verify a transaction and do proof-of-work.


* **Scalability Issues:** Its transactions are processed and completed slowly. This harms scalability. Because the more we try to expand the network's size, the slower it will become.
High Energy Consumption: The proof-of-work device is expensive and requires lots of energy. Technology will undoubtedly need to develop energy-efficient consensus methods.
Uses of Public Blockchain -


* **Voting:** Governments can use a public blockchain to vote, ensuring openness and trust.
Fundraising: Businesses or initiatives can use the public Blockchain to improve transparency and trust.

# Private Blockchain

- A blockchain network operates in a private context, such as a restricted network, or is controlled by a single identity.


- While it has a similar peer-to-peer connection and decentralization to a public blockchain network, this Blockchain is far smaller.


- They are often run on a small network within a firm or organization rather than open to anybody who wants to contribute processing power.


- Permissioned blockchains and business blockchains are two more terms for them.


## Advantages of Private Blockchain -


- **Speed:** Private Blockchain transactions are faster. This is because a private network has a smaller number of nodes, which shortens the time it takes to verify a transaction.


- **Scalability:** You can tailor the size of your private Blockchain to meet your specific requirements. This makes private blockchains particularly scalable since they allow companies to easily raise or decrease their network size.


## Disadvantages of Private Blockchain -


- **Trust Building:** In a private network, there are fewer participants than in a private network.


- **Lower Security:** A private blockchain network has fewer nodes or members, so it is more vulnerable to a security compromise.
Centralization: Private blockchains are limited in that they require a central Identity and Access Management (IAM) system to function. This system provides full administrative and monitoring capabilities.
- **Uses of Private Blockchain -**
Supply Chain Management: A private blockchain can be used to manage a company's supply chain.


- **Asset Ownership:** A private blockchain can be used to track and verify assets.


- **Internal Voting:** Internal voting is also possible with a private blockchain.


# Hybrid Blockchain

- Organizations who expect the best of both worlds use a hybrid blockchain, which combines the features of both private and public blockchains.


- It enables enterprises to construct a private, permission-based system alongside a public, permissionless system, allowing them to choose who has access to certain Blockchain data and what data is made public.


- In a hybrid blockchain, transactions and records are typically not made public, but they can be validated if necessary by granting access via a smart contract.


## Advantages of Hybrid Blockchain -
- **Secure:** Hybrid Blockchain operates within a closed environment, preventing outside hackers from launching a 51 percent attack on the network.


- **Cost-Effective:** It also safeguards privacy while allowing third-party contact. Transactions are inexpensive and quick and scale better than a public blockchain network.


## Disadvantages of Hybrid Blockchain -


- **Lack of Transparency:** Because information can be hidden, this type of blockchain isn't completely transparent.


- **Less Incentive:** Upgrading can be difficult, and users have no incentive to participate in or contribute to the network.



## Uses of XDC Hybrid Blockchain -


The [XDC Network](https://xdc.network/)
is a hybrid blockchain that functions on the basis of delegated proof-of-stake (XDPoS) consensus mechanism. With the XDPoS, the XDC Network enables hybrid relay bridges, spontaneous block finality and interoperability for the blockchain users. It has a hybrid architecture that is developer-friendly in nature.

- The XDC blockchain is based on the consortium blockchain paradigm, which distinguishes it from traditional private/permissioned blockchains as well as public blockchain technologies. The XDC blockchain’s public state is accessed by all network participants, which are controlled by various components. With their own permissions, groups of nodes can construct fully permissioned networks.


- Only approved members have access to the private state. The private state contains a record (hash) of transactions. The smart contracts are kept in the blockchain’s public state. The public state can also be used to share fundamental account information. Other data is safely and transparently sent through the XDC platform. The private state can be used to keep personal information safe from the outside world.


- There are several blockchain solutions available today, but the majority of them are unsuitable for real-world use. The XDC hybrid design eliminates the flaws of both private and public blockchains, allowing the XDC protocol to be used in real-world scenarios. It combines the advantages of accessibility, transparency, decentralization and fast transaction speeds of a public blockchain with the privacy, security, and high transaction speeds of a private blockchain.
